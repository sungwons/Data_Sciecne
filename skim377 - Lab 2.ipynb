    "### General Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You will be submitting your assignment to Blackboard. If there are no accompanying files, you should submit *only* your notebook and it should be named using *only* your JHED id: fsmith79.ipynb for example if your JHED id were \"fsmith79\". If the assignment requires additional files, you should name the *folder/directory* your JHED id and put all items in that folder/directory, ZIP it up (only ZIP...no other compression), and submit it to Blackboard.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * do **not** use absolute paths in your notebooks. All resources should appear in the same directory as the rest of your assignments.\n",
    "    * the directory **must** be named your JHED id and **only** your JHED id.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Data Science is as much about what you write (communicating) as the code you execute (researching). In many places, you will be required to execute code and discuss both the purpose and the result. Additionally, Data Science is about reproducibility and transparency. This includes good communication with your team and possibly with yourself. Therefore, you must show **all** work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Avail yourself of the Markdown/Codecell nature of the notebook. If you don't know about Markdown, look it up. Your notebooks should not look like ransom notes. Don't make everything bold. Clearly indicate what question you are answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Submit a cleanly executed notebook. It should say `In [1]` for the first codecell and increase by 1 throughout."

    "There are a few things to note here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We asked what time it was to get the seed but we did not put it directionly into `np.random.seed()`.\n",
    "2. The argument to `np.random.seed()` must be a List.\n",
    "3. We set the seed then got 10 random numbers by calling `np.random.rand(10)`. In practice, this might just be all we want to do (get numbers from the distribution) or we may want to do more calculations.\n",
    "4. We get 10 more random numbers by calling `np.random.rand( 10)`. Notice that these are not the same as the first call. You can think of `random` *in general* as generating a stream of random numbers according to some distribution which we just tap into. We get the first 10, the next 10, the next 25, etc.\n",
    "5. We set the random seed to the same random seed as before.\n",
    "6. We got the same first 10 random numbers. This demonstrates that setting the seed \"resets\" the stream of random numbers. This is what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, before answering each question, we are going to want to set the random seed to some value. Do not do it inside a function that is getting called over and over again, set it at the start of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk a lot more about visualization later but for right now I'm going to introduce the *histogram*. A histogram is a means for visualizing the probability distribution of a continuous variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following problem. I want to generate 100 data points on the range (-5.0, 10.0) that are from a *uniform distribution*. How do I do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I set the random seed.\n",
    "2. I look through the documentation to see if there is a function that will generate the data directly or via a *transformation*.\n",
    "3. I then visualize the data I generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do that:"

    "\n",
    "The **variance** measures the dispersion of the values. A high variance is high dispersion and low variance is low dispersion. Thinking about variance is often problematic because the units are the *square* of whatever units the values are in. For example, if the values (data) are in \"feet\" then variance is \"square feet\". The square root of the variance is the **standard deviation**. The standard deviation has the same units as the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the units are the same, it's still often difficult to conceive of how much deviation an observed standard deviation actually is. The **coefficient of variation**, $v$, is a dimensionless measure of the variability of a distribution. It allows you to compare how disperse two or more distributions might be, even if their means and **standard deviation**s are in completely different units. \n",
    "\n",

    "$v = |\\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}|$\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, it's just the standard deviation as a percent of the mean. It is undefined if the mean is zero. With a little algebra, you can also calculate a desired *standard deviation* given a coefficient of variation. That is, if you have a mean of 12.1 and want about 2.3% variability, you can reverse engineer the standard deviation that would be associated with it. This is important because the random functions for the normal distribution take the mean and standard deviation...not the coefficient of variation. **Do not confuse the coefficient of variation and the variance...they are completely different things.**\n",

    "From Systems Theory (especially Causal Loop Diagrams), we know that we can build pretty complicated models of how the variables in our domain interact both positively and negatively and how they may balance or reinforce each other. We concede that most of the time, we simply cannot get all the relevant data for the domain we want to understand in order to solve whatever our problem is (remember the \"CoNVO\").\n",

    "Now, each observation of $x$ may either be an observation of the *single* system at different *times* (like looking at the economy each month) or observations of many copies of the same system at the same time (like looking at a bunch of people). In either case, the system will be in different states. In the first case because maybe the economy grew, there was a technological innovation (if we modeled it), or there was a natural disaster. In the second case, because all the different copies of the system have different histories and environments. Not to harp on height, but each person may be a different height because of genetics, gene expression, and access to food and types of food throughout their lifetimes so far, and then their age (because we--hopefully--grow as we grow up and--unfortunately--shrink when we age).\n",

    "Now the *dispersion* may be due to a wide number of factors. We are trying to model a complex system with a single distribution. There may be many factors with small effects that cause the dispersion to be large or there may be a few factors with large effects that cause the dispersion to be large.\n",

    "**Each Lab will include an \"On Your Own\" Section. You will get the most out of the class and understand the concepts better if you attempt to do some of the \"On Your Own\" problems. Although they are not required, concepts they embody may find their way into the Problem Sets.**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Using the code from Problem 2, increase the coefficient of variation to the extent that your estimate of the mean is at least 10% off.\n",
    "2. Now increase the number samples generated using that parameterization, until the estimate of the mean is no more than 1% off.\n",
    "3. Explore other distributions, learn where they generally show up, find the Method of Moments estimators for their parameters.\n",
    "4. Combine variables. For example, imagine a system where have two related variables, $x_1$ and $x_2$, $x_1$ is generated from a Bernoulli distribution and $x_2$ is generated from a normal distribution but with different parameters depending on the value of $x_1$. Think about the two means $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ and the two coefficients of variation $v_1$ and $v_2$, starting with values of the mean close together and with large variance, how would those parameters have to change before you could see that there were two distinct distribution?\n",
